# Computer Vision Practice Area - AI Community of Practice

Welcome to the Computer Vision Practice Area within the AI Community of Practice. This space is devoted to advancing the use and understanding of computer vision technologies across the federal government. Here, we share resources, initiate discussions, and showcase examples related to computer vision projects, policies, and best practices.

## üìñ About Computer Vision in Federal Government

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects ‚Äî and then react to what they ‚Äúsee.‚Äù In the federal government, computer vision applications range from enhancing national security through surveillance to improving public services such as document analysis and processing.

## üìö Federal Resources on Computer Vision

Here are some key resources that provide guidance, standards, and insights into leveraging computer vision technologies within the federal government:

- **NIST's Computer Vision Program:** Focuses on measuring and advancing the state of the art in computer vision. [Visit NIST's Computer Vision Program](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/computer-vision-program)
- **Data.gov's Image Datasets:** A repository of government datasets, including images that can be used for computer vision projects. [Explore Image Datasets](https://www.data.gov/)
- **DARPA's Vision Programs:** DARPA has initiated various programs that push the boundaries of computer vision and related fields. [Learn about DARPA Vision Programs](https://www.darpa.mil/)

## üåü Examples of Computer Vision in Government

- **Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR):** Used by law enforcement to help track vehicles of interest.
- **Facial Recognition for Security:** Agencies like DHS and the FBI use facial recognition technologies for security and identification purposes.
- **Document Analysis:** Various federal agencies use computer vision to digitize and analyze documents, improving efficiency in document processing.
- **Land and Resource Management:** Satellites and aerial imagery analysis assist in environmental monitoring, land use planning, and disaster response.
