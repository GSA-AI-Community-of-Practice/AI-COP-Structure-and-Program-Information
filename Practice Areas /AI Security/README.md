# AI Security Practice Area - AI Community of Practice

Welcome to the AI Security Practice Area within the AI Community of Practice. This forum is dedicated to enhancing the understanding and implementation of security measures in AI technologies across the federal government. Here, we share resources, initiate discussions, and highlight examples and best practices related to securing AI systems, data protection, and ethical AI use.

## üìñ About AI Security in the Federal Government

AI Security encompasses the practices, tools, and methodologies designed to ensure AI systems are developed, deployed, and maintained securely. It covers aspects such as data privacy, model integrity, adversarial resistance, and ethical considerations. In the federal government, ensuring the security of AI systems is paramount to protect sensitive information, maintain public trust, and ensure AI technologies serve the public good responsibly and safely.

## üìö Federal Resources on AI Security

Below are key resources that provide insights into AI Security standards, guidelines, and initiatives within the federal government:

- **NIST AI Security:** Guidance on securing AI systems, including publications on AI risk management and cybersecurity. [Visit NIST AI Security](https://www.nist.gov/topics/artificial-intelligence)
- **Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA):** Resources on protecting critical infrastructure, with relevant information on AI security. [Explore CISA Resources](https://www.cisa.gov/)
- **Office of Management and Budget (OMB) AI Guidelines:** Policies and guidelines for the deployment and management of AI technologies in federal agencies. [Read OMB AI Guidelines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/)

## üåü Examples of AI Security in Government

- **Secure AI Development Frameworks:** Implementing secure coding practices and frameworks to protect AI codebases and data.
- **Adversarial AI Testing:** Conducting red team exercises against AI systems to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.
- **Data Privacy Enhancements:** Utilizing techniques like differential privacy in AI models to enhance data protection.
- **Ethical AI Use Audits:** Establishing review boards and audit trails to ensure AI applications adhere to ethical guidelines and privacy laws.
