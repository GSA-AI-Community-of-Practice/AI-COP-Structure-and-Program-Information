# Contributing to GSA Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GSA Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice! We value the contributions from our community members and look forward to your participation.

## How We Work

We use GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

If you are new to GitHub, you might want to start with a [basic tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/git-and-github-learning-resources) and check out a guide to making [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Contributions

We actively welcome your pull requests and contributions to improve the Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice resources.

1. **Fork the Repo**  
   Fork the repository by clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   Create a branch from where you want to base your work (this is usually the main branch of our repository).

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   Make your changes in your forked repository. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style of the project to maximize the chance of your changes being merged directly.

4. **Be Responsive**  
   Be responsive when making changes based on code reviews. Maintainers may ask you to complete additional designs, tests, or other changes before your pull request is ultimately accepted.

## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Report a problem by [opening a new issue](https://(https://github.com/GSA-AI-Community-of-Practice/issues); it's that easy!

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. **Include Screenshots and Animated GIFs**  
   You can use tools like [recordit](http://recordit.co/) or [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to give reviewers a visual understanding of the changes proposed.

2. **Documentation**  
   Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.

3. **Increase the Version Numbers**  
   As needed, update the version numbers in examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
